The dataset here is the [Clustered Nanopore Reads (CNR) Dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/clustered-nanopore-reads-dataset) from Microsoft. It is represented by two files:

- *Centers.txt* This files contains 10,000 strings of length 110 in the alphabet {A,C,G,T} generated uniformly at random.

- *Clusters.txt* This file contains 269,709 noisy nanopore reads of DNA sequences corresponding to strings in the file Centers.txt. Reads are arranged into clusters separated by lines of multiple "=" signs. Clusters follow the same order as the strings in the file Centers.txt, i.e., the first cluster contains reads corresponding to the DNA sequence represented by first string in Centers.txt, the second cluster contains reads corresponding to the DNA sequence represented by the second string in Centers.txt, etc. Note that some of the clusters might be empty, i.e., there are no reads corresponding to some strings in Centers.txt.
